## About The Project

**GATE Planner & Insights** is a data-driven dashboard designed to help students prepare for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Unlike traditional to-do lists, this application focuses on strategic visualization.

It analyzes past year question (PYQ) data to generate actionable insights, applies the **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** to identify high-yield topics, and provides a feasibility timeline to keep preparation on track.

- **Pareto Mode (80/20):**  
  A dedicated mode that filters the syllabus into "Vital Few" (Top 50% impact) and "Trivial Many".

- **Roadmap Generator:**  
  Auto-calculates a phased study plan based on the days remaining until the exam.

- **Burndown Charts:**
