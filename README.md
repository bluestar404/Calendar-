About The Project

GATE Planner & Insights is a data-driven dashboard designed to help students prepare for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Unlike traditional to-do lists, this application focuses on strategic visualization.

It analyzes past year question (PYQ) data to generate actionable insights, applies the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) to identify high-yield topics, and provides a feasibility timeline to keep preparation on track.

Key Features

Data-Driven Insights

Topic Weightage Analysis: Visualize which topics carry the most marks using interactive Bar and Polar charts.

Concentration Metrics: Instantly identify the top 5 topics that make up the majority of a subject's score.

Strategic Tools

Pareto Mode (80/20): A dedicated mode that filters the syllabus into "Vital Few" (Top 50% impact) and "Trivial Many".

Roadmap Generator: Auto-calculates a phased study plan based on the days remaining until the exam.

Burndown Charts: Visualizes the "Ideal Path to Victory" vs. current progress.

Modern Experience

Glassmorphism UI: A premium, translucent design aesthetic with animated gradients.

Interactive Visuals: Powered by Chart.js for responsive and animated data plotting.

Professional Iconography: Integrated Phosphor Icons for a cohesive look.
